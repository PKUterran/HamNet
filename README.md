# HamNet
Conformation-Guided Molecular Representation with Hamiltonian Neural Networks. In ICLR 2021

This work is not yet fully updated for reproduction.

As our team is busy recently, it might be in late June that HamNet is ready... Sorry for the inconvenience.

Still, you can run the `xxx.slurm` to reproduce the results claimed in paper.
- Run `fit.slurm` first (run `fit2.slurm` if you don't need adj3_loss)
- Run molecule property prediction jobs with the trained HamEngine (molecule conformation generator)
